# About-Nitinjeet-Sahu
’m Nitinjeet Sahu, a student and young author driven by discipline, clarity, and long-term purpose. Writing helps me think, question, and grow. I value consistency over shortcuts and believe real progress comes from quiet effort, strong fundamentals, and learning with intent.
